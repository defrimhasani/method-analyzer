# method-analyzer

This project represents a static code analzyer that is focused on the following metrics/results

* Calculates the cyclomatic complexity for the method under test
* Provides random input data for each method parameter
* Calculates the minimum test case and maximum test case numbers (including condition duplicates on inner blocks)
* Provides data examples for each parameter that is part of any condition in the method (if statements and for loops)

This tool is a javafx desktop based application and it generates a .pdf report after the method was analyzed.
